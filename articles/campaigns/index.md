#Campaigns
Campaigns are the cornerstone of DailyStory - everything in DailyStory first starts with a campaign. 

New leads are assigned to campaigns and all capabilities around reporting, budgeting and lead generation must be associated with a campaign.

DailyStory supports an unlimited number of campaigns and there is no restriction for how you model you business (e.g. you could create a single campaign or quarterly campaigns). 

> A best practice is to create a campaign for specific activities such as *Black Friday Sales* or *Free Trial*.

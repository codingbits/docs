#Campaigns
Campaigns are the cornerstone of DailyStory - everything in DailyStory first starts with a campaign. New leads are assigned to campaigns and all capabilities around reporting, budgeting and lead generation first require a campaign they are associated with.

DailyStory supports an unlimited number of campaigns and there is no restriction for how you model you business (e.g. you could create a single campaign or quarterly campaigns). A best practice is to create a campaign for specific activities such as <code>Black Friday Sales</code> or <code>Free Trial</code>.

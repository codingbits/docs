#Your Guide to Getting Started with DailyStory
Welcome to DailyStory! We put this guide together to help you get started using DailyStory.

It helps to follow along with a DailyStory account. If you don't have a DailyStory account, you can  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dailystory.com/trial">create a 30-day trial to start</a>.

<ol class="step"><li value="1">Install the Tracking Tag</li></ol>

The first thing you need to do is [install the DailyStory tracking tag](/install). 

The tracking tag is a small piece of JavaScript that needs to be added to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of all your pages.

> The DailyStory tracking tag is similar to other tags, such as Google Analytics.

<ol class="step"><li value="2">Create a Campaign</li></ol>
Once you have the tracking tag setup, you'll want to [create some campaigns](/campaigns/#creating-a-campaign).

> We've created a campaign for you already: My First Campaign.

Everything in DailyStory is associated with a campaign. For example, if you have a set of customers that you want to enroll in a drip campaign, send emails for a new trial, or track signups on a form, you'll first need a campaign.

#Your Guide to Getting Started with DailyStory
Welcome to DailyStory! We put this guide together to help you get started using DailyStory.

It helps to follow along with a DailyStory account. If you don't have a DailyStory account, you can  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dailystory.com/trial">create a 30-day trial to start</a>.

You will find that your DailyStory trial is pre-populated with sample data. Feel free to delete this, modify it or add to it. You can easily delete this trial data later when you convert to a commercial edition.

<ol class="step"><li value="1">Install the Tracking Tag</li></ol>

While the trial does include some sample data, to begin using your 30-day trial on your own website, you'll need to install [install the DailyStory tracking tag](/install). 

The tracking tag is a small piece of JavaScript that needs to be added to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of all your pages.

> The DailyStory tracking tag is similar to other tags, such as Google Analytics.

We have instructions for [installing the tracking tag manually](/install/manual) as well as using our [WordPress plugin](/install/wordpress).

<ol class="step"><li value="2">Create a Campaign</li></ol>
Once you have the tracking tag setup, you'll want to [create some campaigns](/campaigns/#creating-a-campaign).

> Your DailyStory trial comes with several example campaigns.

Everything in DailyStory is associated with a campaign. For example, if you have a set of customers that you want to enroll in a drip campaign, send emails for a new trial, or track signups on a form, you'll first need a campaign.

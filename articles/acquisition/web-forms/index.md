# What is a DailyStory Web Form?
DailyStory enables you to quickly and easily create web forms that can be shown on your website, in our mobile application, a DailyStory landing page, or elsewhere using the DailyStory API.

Creating new web forms and editing existing webforms can be found by:

* Signing in to your DailyStory account
* Navigating to Acquisition > Web Forms	
	
![DailyStory Web Form](/articles/acquisition/web-forms/webforms-01.png "DailyStory Web Form")

This opens the All Web Forms list which shows a list of all web forms. Clicking on a web form will open the Edit Web Form Designer.

To create a new web form, click <code>+ New Web Form</code>

## Create a Web Form
When the <code>+ New Web Form</code> button is clicked the Create New Web Form designer is opened.

The first step is to select a campaign that the web form is associated with: 

![DailyStory Web Form](/articles/acquisition/web-forms/webforms-02.png "DailyStory Web Form")

This ensures that all leads or customers that complete this web form are associated with the right campaign. 

> By associating the web form with a campaign, the campaign will be given the attribution for the lead or customer conversion.

Once the campaign is selected the Web Form Designer is available:

## Web Form Designer	
The Web Form Designer enables you to create or edit an existing web form. Each web form requires:
	
* **A name** - a friendly name for the web form, such as Contact Us.
* **A destination URL** - where the form should send the browser once the form is completed.

The web form itself can have multiple form items, but the email address field is required and cannot be removed.

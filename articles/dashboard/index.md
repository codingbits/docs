## Conversion KPIs
The top of the dashboard provides a list of conversion KPIs:

* Lead Forecast - leads or customers that are forecasted to be created for the current month.
* MCL Conversion Rate - the rate at which you are converting visitors into identified contacts.
* MQL Conversion Rate - the rate at which you are converting visitors into identified customers or opportunities.
* Total Suspects - the number of unique visitors in your funnel. This is the demoninator for calculating conversion rates.
* Total MCLs - the total number of contacted leads. This is the numerator for MCL conversion rate.
* Total MQLs - the total number of qualified opportunities or customers. This is the numerator for the MQL conversion rate.

Next, you are presented with 3 graphs.

## Leads
The Leads graph provides a visual view of the number of visitors you have converted into identified accounts over the past 60 days.

In addition to providing a visual overview, you can click on a point in the graph to drill down into that particular day to get more detail. This will open the [Conversion Rate Funnel report](/articles/reports/conversion-rate-funnel).
